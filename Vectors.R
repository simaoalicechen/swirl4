| The simplest and most common data structure in R is the vector.

...
  |==                                                                   |   3%
| Vectors come in two different flavors: atomic vectors and lists. An atomic
| vector contains exactly one data type, whereas a list may contain multiple
| data types. We'll explore atomic vectors further before we get to lists.

...
  |====                                                                 |   5%
| In previous lessons, we dealt entirely with numeric vectors, which are one
| type of atomic vector. Other types of atomic vectors include logical,
| character, integer, and complex. In this lesson, we'll take a closer look at
| logical and character vectors.

...
  |=====                                                                |   8%
| Logical vectors can contain the values TRUE, FALSE, and NA (for 'not
| available'). These values are generated as the result of logical
| 'conditions'. Let's experiment with some simple conditions.

...
  |=======                                                              |  11%
| First, create a numeric vector num_vect that contains the values 0.5, 55,
| -10, and 6.

> 
> 
> num_vect<-c(0.5, 55, -10, 6)

| Excellent job!
  |=========                                                            |  13%
| Now, create a variable called tf that gets the result of num_vect < 1, which
| is read as 'num_vect is less than 1'.

> tf<-(num_vect<1)

| Not exactly. Give it another go. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use tf <- num_vect < 1 to assign the result of num_vect < 1 to a variable
| called tf.

> tf <- num_vect < 1

| All that hard work is paying off!
  |===========                                                          |  16%
| What do you think tf will look like?

1: a vector of 4 logical values
2: a single logical value

Selection: 1

| That's the answer I was looking for.
  |=============                                                        |  18%
| Print the contents of tf now.

> print(tf)
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

| One more time. You can do it! Or, type info() for more options.

| Just type tf and press Enter to view the its value.

> tf
[1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!
  |===============                                                      |  21%
| The statement num_vect < 1 is a condition and tf tells us whether each
| corresponding element of our numeric vector num_vect satisfies this
| condition.

...
  |================                                                     |  24%
| The first element of num_vect is 0.5, which is less than 1 and therefore the
| statement 0.5 < 1 is TRUE. The second element of num_vect is 55, which is
| greater than 1, so the statement 55 < 1 is FALSE. The same logic applies for
| the third and fourth elements.

...
  |==================                                                   |  26%
| Let's try another. Type num_vect >= 6 without assigning the result to a new
| variable.

> num_vect>=6
[1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE

| Your dedication is inspiring!
  |====================                                                 |  29%
| This time, we are asking whether each individual element of num_vect is
| greater than OR equal to 6. Since only 55 and 6 are greater than or equal to
| 6, the second and fourth elements of the result are TRUE and the first and
| third elements are FALSE.

...
  |======================                                               |  32%
| The `<` and `>=` symbols in these examples are called 'logical operators'.
| Other logical operators include `>`, `<=`, `==` for exact equality, and `!=`
| for inequality.

...
  |========================                                             |  34%
| If we have two logical expressions, A and B, we can ask whether at least one
| is TRUE with A | B (logical 'or' a.k.a. 'union') or whether they are both
| TRUE with A & B (logical 'and' a.k.a. 'intersection'). Lastly, !A is the
| negation of A and is TRUE when A is FALSE and vice versa.

...A|B
  |=========================                                            |  37%
| It's a good idea to spend some time playing around with various combinations
| of these logical operators until you get comfortable with their use. We'll
| do a few examples here to get you started.

...

| Try your best to predict the result of each of the following statements. You

| Nice try, but that's not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again.

| This is a tricky one. Remember that the `!` symbol negates whatever comes
| after it. There's also an 'order of operations' going on here. Conditions
| that are enclosed within parentheses should be evaluated first. Then, work
| your way outwards.

1: TRUE
2: FALSE

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

| Don't worry if you found these to be tricky. They're supposed to be. Working
| with logical statements in R takes practice, but your efforts will be
| rewarded in future lessons (e.g. subsetting and control structures).

...
  |====================================                                 |  53%
| Character vectors are also very common in R. Double quotes are used to
| distinguish character objects, as in the following example.

...
  |======================================                               |  55%
| Create a character vector that contains the following words: "My", "name",
| "is". Remember to enclose each word in its own set of double quotes, so that
| R knows they are character strings. Store the vector in a variable called
| my_char.

> my_char<-c("My", "name", "is")

| You are amazing!
  |========================================                             |  58%
| Print the contents of my_char to see what it looks like.

> my_char
[1] "My"   "name" "is"  

| Your dedication is inspiring!
  |==========================================                           |  61%
| Right now, my_char is a character vector of length 3. Let's say we want to
| join the elements of my_char together into one continuous character string
| (i.e. a character vector of length 1). We can do this using the paste()
| function.

...
  |============================================                         |  63%
| Type paste(my_char, collapse = " ") now. Make sure there's a space between
| the double quotes in the `collapse` argument. You'll see why in a second.

> paste(my_char, collapse="")
[1] "Mynameis"

| Nice try, but that's not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again. Or, type
| info() for more options.

| Use paste(my_char, collapse = " ") to collapse the words in the vector so
| they almost form a sentence. There should be a single space between the
| double quotes in the `collapse` argument so that there are single spaces
| separating the words.

> paster(my_char, collapse=" ")
Error in paster(my_char, collapse = " ") : 
  could not find function "paster"
> paste(my_char, collapse=" ")
[1] "My name is"

| You got it right!
  |=============================================                        |  66%
| The `collapse` argument to the paste() function tells R that when we join
| together the elements of the my_char character vector, we'd like to separate
| them with single spaces.

...
  |===============================================                      |  68%
| It seems that we're missing something.... Ah, yes! Your name!

...
  |=================================================                    |  71%
| To add (or 'concatenate') your name to the end of my_char, use the c()
| function like this: c(my_char, "your_name_here"). Place your name in double
| quotes where I've put "your_name_here". Try it now, storing the result in a
| new variable called my_name.

> my_name<-c(my_char, "Alice")

| Great job!
  |===================================================                  |  74%
| Take a look at the contents of my_name.

> my_name
[1] "My"    "name"  "is"    "Alice"

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!
  |=====================================================                |  76%
| Now, use the paste() function once more to join the words in my_name
| together into a single character string. Don't forget to say collapse = " "!

> paste(my_name, collapse=" ")
[1] "My name is Alice"

| You are really on a roll!
  |======================================================               |  79%
| In this example, we used the paste() function to collapse the elements of a
| single character vector. paste() can also be used to join the elements of
| multiple character vectors.

...
  |========================================================             |  82%
| In the simplest case, we can join two character vectors that are each of
| length 1 (i.e. join two words). Try paste("Hello", "world!", sep = " "),
| where the `sep` argument tells R that we want to separate the joined
| elements with a single space.

> paste("Hello", "world!", sep=" ")
[1] "Hello world!"

| Keep up the great work!
  |==========================================================           |  84%
| For a slightly more complicated example, we can join two vectors, each of
| length 3. Use paste() to join the integer vector 1:3 with the character
| vector c("X", "Y", "Z"). This time, use sep = "" to leave no space between
| the joined elements.

> 
> c("X", "Y", "Z")
[1] "X" "Y" "Z"

| Nice try, but that's not exactly what I was hoping for. Try again. Or, type
| info() for more options.

| Use paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "") to see what happens when we join
| two vectors of equal length using paste().

> c("X", "Y", "Z", sep="")
            sep 
"X" "Y" "Z"  "" 

| Give it another try. Or, type info() for more options.

| Use paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "") to see what happens when we join
| two vectors of equal length using paste().

> paste(1:3, c("X", "Y", "Z"), sep = "")
[1] "1X" "2Y" "3Z"

| Excellent work!
  |============================================================         |  87%
| What do you think will happen if our vectors are of different length? (Hint:
| we talked about this in a previous lesson.)

...
  |==============================================================       |  89%
| Vector recycling! Try paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-"), where LETTERS is a
| predefined variable in R containing a character vector of all 26 letters in
| the English alphabet.

> paste(LETTERS, 1:4, sep = "-")
 [1] "A-1" "B-2" "C-3" "D-4" "E-1" "F-2" "G-3" "H-4" "I-1" "J-2" "K-3" "L-4"
[13] "M-1" "N-2" "O-3" "P-4" "Q-1" "R-2" "S-3" "T-4" "U-1" "V-2" "W-3" "X-4"
[25] "Y-1" "Z-2"

| You nailed it! Good job!
  |================================================================     |  92%
| Since the character vector LETTERS is longer than the numeric vector 1:4, R
| simply recycles, or repeats, 1:4 until it matches the length of LETTERS.

...
  |=================================================================    |  95%
| Also worth noting is that the numeric vector 1:4 gets 'coerced' into a
| character vector by the paste() function.

...
  |===================================================================  |  97%
| We'll discuss coercion in another lesson, but all it really means is that
| the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the output above are no longer numbers to R,
| but rather characters "1", "2", "3", and "4".
